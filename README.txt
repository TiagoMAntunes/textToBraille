# textToBraille

textToBraille.py is a python3 program which translates ASCII text to simple Braille. 
For the note, I do not know how to write in Braille so experienced people might notice that it can be optimized.

Feel free to make your own changes to the code and post them online.

The text entered is turned into 0's and 1's, 0 being no dot and 1 being dot.

So it prints text like this:

00101010101000111100111001101111
00110110100100000100101110010101
01000010101000101100001000001000

The text above means: "Hello my friend"

The code only works with A-Z a-z and spaces, ignoring any other thing entered or possibly giving wrong output.
